## 💻 Software Stack

* **Framework:** Arduino / PlatformIO
* **Graphics:** https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI
* **Touch:** https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/XPT2046_Touchscreen
* **IDE:** VS Code + PlatformIO

## ⚙️ Installation & Build

1. Clone the repository
2. Open in VS Code with PlatformIO
3. Get flash.bin and config.map from B4J Uploader and place them in SD Card for testing.  Select PIC config and load intel hex file. It will automatically create those required files.

## Note
* You can experiment with BLE by powering on and off the HM-10 and checking the status.  Also, removing and inserting the SD Card and checking with **FLASH** button.  In the future i will include a working flash uploader for Microchip.
